-- Youâ€™re given a table that represents search results from searches on Facebook.
-- The query column is the search term, position column represents each position the search result came in,
-- and the rating column represents the human rating of the result from 1 to 5 where 5 is high relevance and 1 is low relevance.

-- Write a query to get the percentage of search queries where all of the ratings for the query results are less than a rating of 3.
-- Please round your answer to two decimal points.

-- search_results table

-- result_id	INTEGER (primary key)
-- query	    TEXT
-- position	    INTEGER
-- rating	    INTEGER

-- Output:
-- percentage_less_than_3	FLOAT



-- Main idea: Find out each query's all ratings which are all less than three, and count it's percentage.
